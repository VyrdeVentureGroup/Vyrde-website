                <p>1. The Vyrde Sites are built upon an infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, including physical security of our equipment to system intrusion detection capabilities. Within such our sites, we use industry standard encryption technologies to help safeguard your information.</p>
                <p>2. Security is a cooperative effort between us and the users of the Vyrde Sites. Please remember that your user identification and password are personal to you and should not be made available to any other person. Also, you should discontinue their use and notify us if you have any reason to suspect that someone else may be using them.</p>
                <p>3. “Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your web browser when you visit our websites. Cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website by, among other things, “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you navigate between our website pages and/or access our services. Authentication (i.e., verifying that you are who you say you are) is an essential component of site security. You can set your web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or to prevent cookies from being set. Please note that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality, slower site response times, and declining to use our authentication-related cookies may prevent you from using our website altogether.</p>
                <p>4. Web surfing data (e.g., information regarding which of our web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences) may be collected by Vyrde, or by our service providers. This may be accomplished by using cookies, Web beacons, page tags or similar tools that are set when you visit our website. Web surfing data and similar information may be shared internally within Vyrde and used: for administrative purposes; to assess the usage, value and performance of our online products and services; to improve your experience with our websites; and as otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation. If you are a Vyrde client, this information helps us suggest products or service offerings that may be of interest to you. This information may be processed by us for the purposes described above, or on our behalf by Third Party Services, solely in accordance with our instructions.</p>
                <p>5. Vyrde Sites may include social media features (“Features”), such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on this Site (“Widgets”). These Features and Widgets may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on a Vyrde Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature or Widget to function properly. Social media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on a Vyrde Site. Your interactions with these Features and Widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

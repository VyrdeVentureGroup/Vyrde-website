                <p><b>CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</b></p>
                <p>Copyright Complaints: Vyrde respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify Vyrde in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</p>
                <p>Vyrde will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to: <a href="mailto:info@vyrde.com" target="_blank">info@vyrde.com</a>.</p>
                <p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>
                <p>1. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest.</p>
                <p>2. A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed.</p>
                <p>3. A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on a Vyrde Site, with enough detail that we may find it on a Vyrde Site.</p>
                <p>4. Your address, telephone number, and email address.</p>
                <p>5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.</p>
                <p>6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.</p>
                <p><b>SECURITIES PRODUCTS</b></p>
                <p>None of the information contained in the publicly accessible portions of the Vyrde Sites constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer by Vyrde or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities, futures, options or other financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or service. The information contained in the Vyrde Sites has been prepared without reference to any particular user’s investment requirements or financial situation. The information and services provided on the Vyrde Sites are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or regulatory or self-regulatory organization or clearing organization or where Vyrde is not authorized to provide such information or services. Some products and services described in the Vyrde Sites may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.</p>
                <p><b>INDEMNITY AND RELEASE</b></p>
                <p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold Vyrde harmless from any from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Vyrde Sites. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>
                <p><b>CHOICE OF LAW</b></p>
                <p>The Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by you and us, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach hereof, shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or such arbitration body as required by law, rule or regulation, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator in the City of Atlanta, Georgia. Such arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement, or a portion thereof, shall be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of this Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to this site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements and understandings between Vyrde and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. A printed version of this Agreement shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.</p>
